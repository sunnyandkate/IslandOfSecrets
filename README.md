# IslandOfSecrets
This Game was made for the GameOff2024 with the Theme “Secrets”. It is inspired by the Idea to make a game about the NPC’s life. 

Explore an adventure while you follow the Detective Cat to solve the Secrets of the NPC’s. 
Walk through the town on the Island of Secrets and try to find out the secrets of each NPC.
